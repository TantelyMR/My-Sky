# 🎨 My Space

Welcome to my interactive portfolio – I hope you have fun exploring the page.
This isn’t just a resume page. It’s a cross-platform showcase **engineered to be as dynamic and polished as the projects it features.**

## ✨ Features

- **Live, Interactive UI**  
  Everything you see is built with custom React components – no cookie-cutter templates here.  

- **Fully Responsive**  
  Whether you’re browsing on desktop, mobile, or your favorite tablet, the experience adapts seamlessly.

- **Accessible & Fast**  
  Under the hood: semantic HTML, a11y-first design, and fast page loads thanks to Vite bundling and code splitting.

- **Progressive Web App**  
  Install it on your device, launch it like an app, or share the link for instant, app-like previews with rich OpenGraph tags.

- **Bespoke Dark Mode Aesthetic**  
  With hand-crafted iconography and layered visual effects (including those rainbow gradients!), it’s got both style and substance.

## 🛠️ Dev Philosophy

This portfolio isn’t just a project list—it’s a living demo of how I approach software:  
- **Precision:** Each component exists for a reason.  
- **Creativity:** Every icon, transition, and layout was made from scratch or custom-tweaked.  
- **Performance:** Optimized images, and best-practices for SEO and accessibility.
